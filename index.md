### Education

In July 2017, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering of Computing Systems from Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi).

I was accepted as a student to the EIT Digital Master's Programme in Data Science starting Autumn 2017. I completed the first year at Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi) and then transferred from Milan, Italy to Stockholm, Sweden, where I studied at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (KTH).
